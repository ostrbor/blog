Sometimes I read books on math and here I want to share my
observations on why we use such strange formula to calculate standard
deviation. We will invent our own formulas, play with simple numbers
and later will see why we have to square and why denominator is 'N-1'
not 'N'.

Standard deviation is basic measure in Statistics. I think it will be
interesting to know why it has such formula, not another:
sqrt(sum(sqr(X-x)))/N, where X is value in population, x is mean and N
is number of values.

Imagine somebody was diagnosed with lethal disease and he was
suggested to take experimental drugs that prolong life for about 12
months (on average). In this case population is all people who took
part in medical experiment in past and mean is equal to 12 months. But
really knowing about only average lifetime is not enough to evaluate
the most likely range of months to live. Because mean is just middle
value around which may be majority of scores, lying extremely far away
from middle point or very close to it.

Average deviation as average measure among all differences between
each score of population and mean, helps us better understand
distribution. If in our example deviation is equal to 10 months, then
it means that half of all cases lies in range 2-22 months. If
deviation is 1, than range is 11-13.

Deviation helps us to understand how scores are distributed around
mean. But how to calculate it? First thought:
absolute deviation = sum(|X-x|)/N
We must use modulus because subtraction might be negative, but we want
to sum all differences.

Now let's check our first formula on practice. Consider this two
simple populations:
a)0 0 0 2 4 4
b)-1 0 1 2 3 4 5

They have same mean, same absolute deviation. But wait. Is deviation
really the same? Don't you think that second example is more deviated
from mean? We have to change our formula to reflect this
observation. Here is useful arithmetic trick: square.

Consider two equations:
a) 1 + 2 = 3
b) sqr(1) + sqr(2) = 5

Now answer how number '1' and squared '1' influences the sum in first
and second case?  How '2' and squared '2' participate in result? What
part do they take in result? In other words what is the weight of each
summand before and after squaring.

Weight of '1' and squared '1' is 33% (of '3') and 20% (of '5').
Weight of '2' and squared '2' is 66% (of '3') and 80% (of '5').

As you can see after squaring, big numbers have more weight than small
numbers. The weight of small numbers is decreasing and of big numbers
is increasing while power is getting bigger.

If we want our deviation to depend on big differences stronger than we
must increase their weight. That's why we square. It's really
doesn't matter how sum becomes big (whether it's '3' or '5'). Because
we need this sum to compare with another sum of another population.

Now apply squares in our example: first value is 4 and second is
4,7. According to these values we can see that two populations are not
the same. Variance of second is bigger. And our new value is called
variance in statistics. Arithmetically it's average squared
deviation. How to get standard deviation? Just calculate square root.

Why we use power of two? Why not others? Well, you can if you
want. But first, if power is odd then don't forget modulus. Second,
less power easier calculate. Third, name new formula and become
famous -).

In statistics it's usual to operate with sample, not with whole
distribution. And if we calculate mean of sample and of population
then they are rarely the same. What do you think, how any change to
mean would influence result? Suppose in our example '0 0 0 2 4 4 4' we
use by mistake as mean number '3' (or any other) not '2'. In this case
variance will always be bigger than real variance. Because mean is
middle point that is equally far from all other values. If you use as
mean another value on position different from middle then this new
false mean will be closer to one set of numbers and farther from
others. As you remember bigger distances or bigger numbers influence
variance stronger. So variance always be bigger. The lowest variance
if the real, that is calculated on whole population.

That's why when we have small sample we should correct variance. The
lower sample the bigger correction. For this purpose we can use as
denominator not just 'N' but 'N-1'. The lower 'N' the bigger weight of
'1'. The bigger 'N' the lower weight of '1' in denominator. In other
words does it really change the fraction if we subtract '1' from 'N'
equal to billions?

That's it. Hope you like it.
